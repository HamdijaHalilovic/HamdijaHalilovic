Hi everybodyðŸ‘‹, my name is Hamdija and I am proud to be a graduate from Le Wagon's web development bootcamp. 
Le Wagon taught me how to code and this is something that I really love 

- ðŸ”­ Even though I have successfully finished the bootcamp, I will continue to learn new things and also become more confident in what I already know.
- ðŸŒ± I would like to find a job in development as I see this as my future career.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me through email, my github or LinkedIn

All the best,
Hamdija
